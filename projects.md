### Utilities

[ImageDiff](https://github.com/Tylerflick/ImageDiff)  
A small commmand line app for macOS written in Swift. It uses a Metal compute shader to determine if two input images are different and if so, outputs a difference image. I originally wrote this app to speed up testing the output of a document rasterizer against a baseline.

### Services

[go-bamboo](https://github.com/Tylerflick/go-bamboo)  
go-bamboo is a library for polling Atlassian Bamboo Server builds. It's writen in Go, and built to serve as a small SDK for getting build results.


### Embedded

[LPC8XX Template](https://github.com/Tylerflick/lpc8xx_template)   
This is a small hardware abstaction layer libary for the NXP LPC 8XX family of microcontrollers. I did this to apply my own style guide and add 1-wire drivers and multiple UART channels.

### Projects I have contributed to

[SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/skiasharp)  
SkiaSharp is C# wrapper around Google's Skia, a 2D rasterization library.

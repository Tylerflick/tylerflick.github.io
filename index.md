### About Me
My name is Tyler Hoeflicker and I'm software engineer. I've worked in a variety of fields to include backend services, full stack web development, mobile apps, desktop programs and graphical rendering.

I live in Los Angeles area, and I'm an avid runner. Fitness is really important to me, and when I'm not at work you can find me running in the San Gabriel mountains.

I still fiddle with embedded development, and I've collected a closet full of components and PCB's I'll probably never use.

### My Background
I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Missouri, where I spent a lot of my time studying embedded systems.

My first job after undergrad was writing high-thoughput order processing services for a large ecommerce business.

After that I spent a couple of years working on mobile apps, primary for iOS. I'm interested in image processsing and parallel operations, which happens to be the area I'm currently working in.

### About Me
My name is Tyler Hoeflicker and I'm a software engineer. I have worked in a variety of fields, which include backend services, full stack web development, mobile apps, desktop programs and 2D rendering.

I have years of experience working professionally with C# and .NET. I'm a fan of Go and use it where I can in my own projects.

I live in the Los Angeles area, and enjoy exploring all the city has to offer. I'm an avid runner and hiker. Fitness is important to me, and when I'm not at work you can find me on a trail.

I have a dog named Wall-E. He is kind of weird, and has an occasional underbite.

### My Background
During the summer between my sophmore and junior years of college, I worked as a tower rigger replacing cell phone antennas. I also learned I have a fear of heights past a certain point.

I earned my Bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri, where I spent much of my time studying embedded systems.

My first job after I completed my undergraduate degree was writing high-throughput services and desktop programs for a mid-sized e-commerce business. I also learned Pascal while working in this role.

After that, I transitioned to a new company and spent a couple of years working on mobile apps, primarily for iOS. I'm currently working on 2D rendering, image processsing and parallel operations.

I still fiddle with embedded development, and I've collected a closet full of components and PCB's I'll probably never use.

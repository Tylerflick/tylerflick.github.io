I'm Tyler and I am a software engineer by day.

I recieved my undergrad from the University of Missouri, where I spent a lot of my time studying embedded systems. I'm interested in image processsing and graphics, which happens to be the field I'm currently working in. Most of my time outside of work is spent running, traveling or designing hobbyist hardware and software.
